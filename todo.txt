To-Do-List (27.09.24):
Package:
[t] implement missing unstuckinators
[ ] fix analyse functions
[ ] check allocations (e.g. updateHist)
[ ] add "measurement count"
[ ] add spacings folder with "search" function to examples

Computation:
[ ] move repo to rwth gitlab
[ ] frequency shift, optimization from optimized state
- direct re-optimization
- sophisticated linesearch beforehand, then re-optimization
[ ] synchronize movement to measurement
[ ] 3d tests
[ ] loss tests?

Analysis:
[ ] check stability on more samples
[ ] optimize more from reflectivity
[ ] check stability on reflectivity
[ ] check stability with loss

Literature:
[ ] Jacob Master Thesis (reflectivity spectrum mainly)




Main:
[x] show redundancy in optimized states
[ ] write paper i guess

New/Cross features:
[ ] reflectivity fitting?
[ ] gradient method?
