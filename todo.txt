To-Do-List (27.09.24):
Package:
[t] implement missing unstuckinators
[ ] fix analyse functions
[ ] check allocations (e.g. updateHist)
[ ] add "measurement count"
[ ] add spacings folder with "search" function to examples

Computation:
[ ] move repo to rwth gitlab
[t] frequency shift, optimization from optimized state
- direct re-optimization
- sophisticated linesearch beforehand, then re-optimization
[ ] synchronize movement to measurement
[ ] 3d tests
[ ] loss tests?
[t] lossy reflectivity objective function: normalize to account for unknown loss
[t] group delay

Analysis:
[x] check stability on more samples
[ ] optimize more from reflectivity
[ ] check stability on reflectivity
[x] check stability with loss

Literature:
[ ] Jacob Master Thesis (reflectivity spectrum mainly)


[ ] add antenna mismatch (different eps in antenna layer (10%) -> move antenna far away from discs)

Main:
[x] show redundancy in optimized states
[ ] write paper i guess

New/Cross features:
[ ] reflectivity fitting?
[ ] gradient method?
