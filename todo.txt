To-Do-List (21.10.24):
Package:
[t] implement missing unstuckinators
[ ] fix analyse functions
[ ] check allocations (e.g. updateHist)
[ ] add "measurement count"
[ ] add spacings folder with "search" function to examples

Computation:
[ ] move repo to rwth (or desy?) gitlab
[t] frequency shift, optimization from optimized state
[ ] direct re-optimization
[t] sophisticated linesearch beforehand, then re-optimization
[ ] synchronize movement to measurement
[ ] 3d tests
[x] loss tests?
[t] lossy reflectivity objective function: normalize to account for unknown loss
[t] group delay

Analysis:
[ ] check stability on more samples
[ ] optimize more from reflectivity
[ ] check stability on reflectivity
[ ] check stability with loss

Literature:
[ ] Jacob Master Thesis (reflectivity spectrum mainly)
[ ] git tutorials

[ ] add antenna mismatch (different eps in antenna layer (10%) -> move antenna far away from discs)
[ ] use davids ana1d code? incorporate effective loss in tand
[ ] check optimized boost dependency on tand
[ ] try to optimize broadband (two peaks) for 6 or less discs
[ ] optimize for reflectivity from higher peak config -> try to optimize for specific peak number


Main:
[x] show redundancy in optimized states
[ ] write paper i guess

New/Cross features:
[ ] reflectivity fitting?
[ ] gradient method?
