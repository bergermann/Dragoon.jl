To-Do-List (15.06.24):
Package:
[t] implement missing unstuckinators
[t] rework examples
[ ] fix analyse functions
[ ] check allocations (e.g. updateHist)
[ ] add "measurement count"
[ ] add spacings folder with "search" function to examples
[x] put cluster scripts in function for program opt

Computation:
[ ] move repo to rwth gitlab
[ ] frequency shift, optimization from optimized state
- direct re-optimization
- sophisticated linesearch beforehand, then re-optimization
[ ] synchronize movement to measurement
[ ] larger performance trials/tests
- completely random initial spacings
- opt by ref from stefans spacings
- check average shift
[ ] 3d tests
[ ] loss tests?

Analysis:
[ ] plot obj value vs movement time
[ ] try clustering results

Main:
[ ] show redundancy in optimized states
[ ] write paper i guess

New/Cross features:
[ ] reflectivity fitting?
[ ] gradient method?
