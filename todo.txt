To-Do-List (05.08.24):
Package:
[t] implement missing unstuckinators
[ ] fix analyse functions
[ ] check allocations (e.g. updateHist)
[ ] add "measurement count"
[ ] add spacings folder with "search" function to examples

Computation:
[ ] move repo to rwth gitlab
[ ] frequency shift, optimization from optimized state
- direct re-optimization
- sophisticated linesearch beforehand, then re-optimization
[ ] synchronize movement to measurement
[ ] 3d tests
[ ] loss tests?

Analysis:
[x] try clustering results
[x] visualize optimized states, differences (i.e. electrical fields) -> direct comparison of e.g. 3 different optimized states
[t] visualize stability of optimized (jensen shannon?)
[x] check systematics of optimized states by algorithm
[ ] recheck unconverged states for anton
[x] try optimizing by minimizing reflectivity in lossy case, check phase
[ ] check stability on more samples
[ ] optimize more from reflectivity
[ ] check stability on reflectivity



Main:
[ ] show redundancy in optimized states
[ ] write paper i guess

New/Cross features:
[ ] reflectivity fitting?
[ ] gradient method?
